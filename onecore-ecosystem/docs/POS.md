# OneCore POS checkout, receipts and controlled returns

The POS foundation supports cashier shifts, catalogue pricing, multi-line sale
synchronization, stock deduction and an encrypted browser transaction queue. This
delivery adds tenant-scoped sale receipt retrieval and supervisor-authorized partial
returns. It is not a complete 24-hour offline POS or a live payment terminal.

## Checkout and offline synchronization

- `GET /api/v1/pos/catalog?branch_id={branch_id}`
- `GET /api/v1/pos/shifts/current?branch_id={branch_id}`
- `POST /api/v1/pos/shifts/open`
- `POST /api/v1/pos/shifts/{id}/close`
- `POST /api/v1/pos/sync`

Checkout prices are read from the tenant product catalogue (`sale_price`), not
accepted from the client. The sale API validates an open shift owned by the cashier
at the selected branch, validates tenant product ownership, checks branch stock,
and requires payment allocations to equal the server-calculated total. A sale and
its inventory issue movements, lines and payment records are committed atomically.
Client transaction IDs are tenant-unique; a canonical request hash makes identical
replays idempotent and conflicting reuse return HTTP 409.

Shift close compares counted cash with opening float plus recorded cash tender and
returns the variance. Credit tenders are stored as unsettled. Cash/card/bank are
recorded tender types only; no acquiring gateway, M-Pesa, STK push or bank
verification is connected.

## Sale receipts and returns

- `GET /api/v1/pos/sales/{sale_id}` returns a tenant- and branch-scoped receipt
  payload, including original sale lines, payment tender records and remaining
  returnable quantity for each line.
- `POST /api/v1/pos/sales/{sale_id}/returns` records a partial or full return.
  The caller must hold the tenant `manage` permission (supervisor/manager).
- A return can only reference lines from the original posted sale. Quantities already
  returned are aggregated and a new return cannot exceed the remaining sold quantity.
- Refund allocations must equal the server-calculated return value and cannot exceed
  the remaining recorded original tender for each refund method. Unsettled credit
  tender is not treated as collected funds.
- Return stock is added through append-only inventory receipt movements in the
  original sale branch. Return IDs are tenant-unique and canonical request hashes
  protect safe retries; conflicting reuse returns HTTP 409.
- Refund rows are accounting records only. `refunds_executed=false` is returned
  because cash drawer payout or card/bank/M-Pesa gateway execution is not automated.
- Return valuation uses the original stored sale line unit price. POS tax allocation,
  discount allocation and accounting journal integration are not yet implemented.

## Browser offline behavior

- POS shell can be cached by the service worker after the first successful visit.
- The last downloaded branch catalogue is encrypted with AES-GCM using a
  non-extractable Web Crypto key stored in IndexedDB.
- Pending transaction payloads are encrypted before IndexedDB persistence.
- Manual and online-event sync sends queued transactions to the idempotent API.
- The browser keeps a local stock snapshot and blocks a sale that exceeds that
  snapshot; the server rechecks stock at sync and rejects stale/oversold transactions.

Offline sale creation requires the page to remain open with a valid in-memory
authenticated session and an open shift. Refreshing the browser loses the access
token; offline login/session restoration is not implemented. The service worker
caches only the POS shell, not private API responses. Browser-profile storage is
not a substitute for managed device encryption, hardware-backed keys or device
attestation.

## Remaining POS requirements

- Multi-product cart controls in the cashier UI (the synchronization API accepts
  multiple lines, but the current checkout form still submits one line).
- Offline re-authentication/device registration, local authorization expiry/revocation
  and a robust 24-hour offline entitlement.
- Discounts, tax calculation, customer accounts, receipt rendering/thermal printing
  and cash drawer integration.
- Cashier permissions, multi-user/multi-till shift reconciliation and approval
  thresholds beyond the manager permission on returns.
- M-Pesa/card/bank gateway integrations, verified callbacks, settlement and
  reconciliation. Manual tender/refund rows are not payment verification/execution.
- Server-side stock reservations, supervisor review of stale offline stock conflicts,
  queue dead-letter/retry visibility, background sync and sync telemetry.
- Bandwidth-aware catalogue refresh, crash recovery, cross-device/cross-branch
  reconciliation, accessibility, threat modelling, browser/device matrix,
  PostgreSQL race tests, performance, security assessment and pilot UAT.
